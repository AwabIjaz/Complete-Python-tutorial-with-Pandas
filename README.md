Check out the .ipynb file (jupyter notebook file) to run and check code examples along with the documentation. 

You can install 'Anaconda Navigator' to get jupyter notebook along with some other tools for writing python. You can also use nbviewer to view a notebook on the web.

I have also included a .pdf file if you just want to check out the documentation.
